Changelog

Unfortunately Version 1.0 to 3.0 does not have any logging. It was in initial days of my coding, so I was not that particular about the changelog maintenence.

1. Version 4.0 - 10 June 2015. 
a. The code is refractored. Now the GUI and the core grammar coding is separated. 
b. The output is sent to browser as well as stored in verboutput folder.
